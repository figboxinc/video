## TODO

- [x] ~~ConferenceRoom.tsx - When room is full, the participant trying to join gets the 'Room is full' message, but his tracks still get published to the room. Stop tracks from publishing~~
- [ ] Countdown.tsx - Timer starts when at least 2 ppl are in room, if 3rd participant joins later, or someone leaves and rejoins, their timer restarts. Find a way to sync all timers.
- [x] ~~ControlBar.tsx - Build out buttons with correct hooks.~~
